# secure-password-generator

## Description

This project aims to create a strong password generator in order to provide more security on the internet when setting up accounts. This is motivated by the increasing number of cyber attacks online, and aims to solve the issue created by passwords that are usually repeated having been being leaked on the Dark web. These passwords are completely random and as such less vulnerable
